As in results3a.txt, running times are not of much interest

It turns out, that optimizations have little effect on executable
sizes. Only in -O0 we see, that dynamic and shared cases
have executables take one disk block (4K) more than when
other optimizations are used.
The reason for this is little code size of the program. Most
of the executable are metadata and boilerplate code present
regardless of potimizations.
We would expect something bigger to compile to different sizes
under different optimizations.
